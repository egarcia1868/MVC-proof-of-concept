# MVC Demo App

A simple app demonstrating my ability to use the MVC design pattern.

## Getting Started

Simply go to [my Eat-Da-Burger app](https://whispering-ridge-27306.herokuapp.com/) on your favorite browser and you'll be able to "add burgers" to add them to the database and click "devour" to change their devoured state, as well as see the burgers that have been devoured.

### Screenshot

This is how the app looks if I have Mushroom Swiss, Chilantro, and El Diablo burgers added and not devoured, and a Hat Creek, Big Mac, and a McDouble already devoured.
