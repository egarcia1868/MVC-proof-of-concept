# MVC Demo App  (Eat-Da-Burger!)

A simple app demonstrating my ability to use the MVC design pattern.

## Getting Started

Simply go to [my Eat-Da-Burger app](https://whispering-ridge-27306.herokuapp.com/) on your favorite browser and you'll be able to "add burgers," "devour burgers," and see the burgers that have been devoured.

This is how the app looks if I have Mushroom Swiss, Chilantro, and El Diablo burgers added and not devoured, and a Hat Creek, Big Mac, and a McDouble already devoured.
